# SurfsUp Results-Analysis-
Using Sqlite and Jupyter Notebook

Overview of Project

-Purpose

W. Avy, our client,  likes our initial analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop.
Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the
surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.


We will do our analysis on a Jupyter Notebook using information from the Sqlite database and using Sqlalchemy.


- Analysis and Results

Please refer to the images for the analysis of the data for the months of June and December.

![](Resources/December.png)

Based on the data the weather is pretty even throughout the year and is ideal for surfing during these two months....except for the following diferences
		1) The mean temperature is lower in December
		2) The standard deviation from the mean temperature is higher in December
		3) the hottest days are in June with the max temperature being the highest.
		4) The collest days are in December with the min temperature being the lowest.


More analysis on the weather throughout the year needs to be done before investing in this venture

- Overall conclusion



- Summary (including 2 queries)

More analysis is required.

Data on rainfall should be analysed - this will impact surfing
Data on wind patterns should also be analysed.
